@PokemonGoApp Why do pokeballs randomly during straight throws curve is there a wind feature or some other explanation????
1) I chauffered my kids around town so they could find Pokemon. I drove to parks and ponds and they directed my car onto random streets.
Even since Pokemon go came out I haven't heard from nadeshot once ??
Just went pokemon hunting for the first time... it confuses me

When Pokemon try to attack before I capture them...

"Y'all finished, or y'all done?"
